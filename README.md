# Smart Waste Management System

A **Smart IoT-based Waste Monitoring Solution** that uses sensors, cloud storage, and a web dashboard to track bin fill levels in real-time. The system helps automate waste collection, reduce manual monitoring, and promote a cleaner environment.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Smart Waste Management System** aims to tackle the challenge of inefficient waste disposal and overflowing bins using IoT technology. It uses ultrasonic sensors to detect bin fill levels and sends this data to a cloud server. When a bin reaches a threshold level, authorities are notified automatically through alerts.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Automate waste level monitoring.
* Reduce manual bin checking and labor costs.
* Improve city cleanliness and hygiene.
* Provide real-time updates for efficient waste collection.
